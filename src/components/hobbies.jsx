                    I have a variety of hobbies that keep me active and entertained. I enjoy playing sports like cricket, badminton, and chess, which combine strategy and physical activity. I also love sprinting, as it tests my speed and stamina. Staying fit is important to me, so I make time for regular exercise. In my free time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, and explore different types of food.
